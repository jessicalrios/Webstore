## RESTful API
The following web application can use the following API:
**products/add**
Adds products by inserting the description, imageURL, name, price, and stock.
**products/example**
This is a testing RESTful API to see if the api call is function correct. If it is functioning correct, then Test should be displayed.
**products/getAll**
Returns all the products stored from the database.
**get/{id}?=_id_**
If _id_ is found, the _id_ after ?= needs to be replaced by the actual ID stored from the database.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's are pictures of different ways to call the api:
